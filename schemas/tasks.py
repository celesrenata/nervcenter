"""Task and TaskRun records (NerveCenter spec Section 10-16).

A *task* is a unit of work scheduled by the core (from a goal, decision, or
connector). A *task run* is a single execution attempt of a task, capturing
timing, status, and the produced :class:`AgentResult`.

Assumptions (spec not present in the repository):
    - ``Task.status`` reflects queue/execution lifecycle; ``TaskRun.status``
      reflects a single attempt outcome.
    - ``priority`` is 0 (lowest) .. 10 (highest), 0 default.
    - A task may schedule multiple runs (retries); ``TaskRun.attempt`` numbers
      them.
