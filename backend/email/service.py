"""In-memory Email service (prompt2 Phase P0).

This is the P0 slice of the Personal Operations Plane: it receives
*normalized* email events from the macOS Personal Relay, reconstructs
threads, and produces
:class:`~backend.api.models.AttentionItem` entries so an unread thread
surfaces in the Now screen (prompt2 §75 acceptance: "a new email thread
appears inside NerveCenter and can produce an AttentionItem").

Design notes
------------
- **NerveCenter never touches a mailbox.** The Personal Relay daemon is the
  ingestion mechanism and it is *out of scope for this deliverable* (the
  §46/§47-style read-only mailbox bridge, explicit permissions, fail closed).
  This service only ever sees normalized email events posted via
  ``POST /api/email/ingest`` — no live EWS/IMAP access in-process.
- **No persistence yet.** P0 deliberately stores threads in process memory so
  the API, the Email screen, and the tests all work without ``NERVE_DB_URL``
  — same convention as the P0 attention store. Public method signatures are
  designed to survive a later swap to a real table.
- **Idempotent ingest.** Email ``message_id``s (Message-ID headers) are
  unique: re-posting the same ``message_id`` is a no-op, which matters
  because the relay replays queued events when connectivity returns (§48)
  and must preserve ordering.
- **Deterministic, explainable.** Attention generation reuses the P0
  :class:`~backend.attention.service.AttentionService` scorer, so "why is
  this thread on my Now screen" is always answerable (§21/§22).
- **Drafts, not sends.** Reply drafting is local and human-in-the-loop
  (prompt2 §13: "AI drafts, human sends"); nothing is ever sent from here.
