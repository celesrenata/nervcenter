"""In-memory Voicemail service (prompt2 Phase P2 — Personal Operations Plane).

This is the P2 slice of the Personal Operations Plane: it receives
*normalized* voicemail events from the macOS Personal Relay, reconstructs
threads, and produces
:class:`~backend.api.models.AttentionItem` entries so an unread thread
surfaces in the Now screen (prompt2 §77 acceptance: "a new voicemail thread
appears inside NerveCenter and can produce an AttentionItem").

Design notes
------------
- **NerveCenter never touches voicemail audio.** The Personal Relay daemon is
  the ingestion mechanism and it is *out of scope for this deliverable* (the
  §46/§47-style source-side bridge: iOS Share Sheet capture, carrier
  voicemail-to-email, and local Whisper transcription, §14/§15). By the time an
  event reaches this service the transcript and provenance are already
  computed; this service only ever sees normalized voicemail events posted via
  ``POST /api/voicemail/ingest`` — no audio, no model, no carrier access
  in-process.
- **No persistence yet.** P2 deliberately stores threads in process memory so
  the API, the Voicemail screen, and the tests all work without
  ``NERVE_DB_URL`` — same convention as the P0/P1 stores. Public method
  signatures are designed to survive a later swap to a real table.
- **Idempotent ingest.** Voicemail ids are unique: re-posting the same
  ``voicemail_id`` is a no-op, which matters because the relay replays queued
  events when connectivity returns (§48) and must preserve ordering.
- **Deterministic, explainable.** Attention generation reuses the P0
  :class:`~backend.attention.service.AttentionService` scorer, so "why is
  this thread on my Now screen" is always answerable (§21/§22). Callback-request
  detection is a deterministic keyword heuristic on the already-transcribed
  text (no model, §15) and records the matched phrase in ``callback_reason``.
- **Detection, not action.** A callback request only flags the thread and
  escalates its AttentionItem; nothing is dialed or drafted from here (§77
  has no reply-drafting for voicemail).
